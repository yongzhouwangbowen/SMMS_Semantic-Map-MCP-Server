# SMMS_Semantic-Map-MCP-Server
The repository SMMS creates an MCP server for instance-level semantic maps and provides a series of functional modules for 3D instance objects in semantic maps.
- Establish a database based on the semantic map to realize the addition, modification, deletion and query of semantic object information.
- Establish RAG retrieval based on the semantic object information library.
- Explore the object-level cognitive map generation method and build a task-driven cognitive topology map.
